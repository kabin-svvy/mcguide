# Problem Three: Merchant's Guide to the Galaxy

# This problem i just write TDD for solve its only not run like program

# Now i will coding about guidebook for merchant of the galaxy 
# and merchant can create new symbol for new number language 
# and can add price of material that they found

# After they create price they can call how much of price that can call
# and they can call how many for the amount material with number that they create

# If something guidebook dont have its will shout like "I have no idea what you are talking about"

# It just demo of TDD for guidebook only
